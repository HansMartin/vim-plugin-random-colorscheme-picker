Power VIM Users like us have already wasted tons of time to choose
our favorite colorschemes, and may still not be satisfied with the 
current colorschemes. So I wrote this plugin to help us out, to 
meet the perfect colorsheme that we are __DESTINED__ to be with. 
just like your lovely girlfriends/wifes:)

### Installation ###
    Just copy randomColorPicker.vim to your VIM runtime plugin path:
    You may need to create ~/.vim/plugin directory if it doesn't exist:
    `mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin`
    then:
    `cp randomColorPicker.vim ~/.vim/plugin`

### Usage ###
    When you use vim open a file, I will randomly pick up a colorscheme
    for you.
    * if you __LOVE__ this colorscheme,
    enter( In Normal Mode )
    `__:Love__` ,
    then I will never change your colorscheme again.

    * if you __HATE__ this colorscheme and don't want to see her again,
    enter( In Normal Mode )
    `__:Hate__`,
    then I will never pick this colorscheme for you and then
    randomly pick a new coloscheme.

    * if you somehow regret what you did and want to get the hated colorscheme
    back, enter(In  Normal Mode) 
    `__:Back__`
    then all you hated colorschem will back to select pool, and you might see
    her again:)

    * enter(In Normal Mode)
    `__:CS__`
    to see current colorscheme
