## ABOUT ##

Power VIM Users like us have already wasted tons of time to choose

our favorite colorschemes, and may still not be satisfied with the 

current colorschemes. So I wrote this plugin to help us out, to 

meet the perfect colorsheme that we are __DESTINED__ to be with. 

just like your lovely girlfriends/wifes:)

### Installation ###
Just copy randomColorPicker.vim to your VIM runtime plugin path:

You may need to create ~/.vim/plugin directory if it doesn't exist:

`mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin`

then:

`cp randomColorPicker.vim ~/.vim/plugin`

### Usage ###
When you use vim open a file, I will randomly pick up a colorscheme
for you.

* __ALL The Commands below are CaseSensitive__

* if you  __LOVE__  this colorscheme,

  Enter( In Normal Mode )

  `:Love`

  then I will never change your colorscheme again.

* if you __HATE__ this colorscheme and don't want to see her again,

  Enter( In Normal Mode )

  `:Hate`

  then I will never pick this colorscheme for you and then

  randomly pick a new coloscheme.

* if you somehow regret what you did and want to get the hated colorscheme back,
    
  Enter(In  Normal Mode) 

  `:Back`

  then all you hated colorschem will back to select pool, and you might see

  her again:)

* Enter(In Normal Mode)

  `:CS`

  to see current colorscheme

### Tips ###
  Use this plugin with a large colorsheme pool
  
  will increase the possibility of meeting the right ColorScheme for you.

  So, I recommand you also use the ColorScheme Pack at:

  [Colo(u)r Sampler Pack : Oct 2012 Update](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=625)

  Big Thanks to __Robert Melton__ for his awesome work!
